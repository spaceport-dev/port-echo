# Port-Echo
Port-Echo is a Spaceport starter kit that provides the most basic structure and configuration
for building a Spaceport application, with no other assumptions.

See also: [Scaffolds](https://spaceport.com.co/docs/scaffolds#port-echo) for more information.


## Getting Started
If this is your first time using Spaceport, perhaps consider starting with PORT-MERCURY 
starter kit which provide the same basic structure and configuration, but provide some basic 
functionality to get you started. Use Port-Echo if you want to start from scratch and want 
to implement the basics yourself.
