# Port-Echo

Port-Echo is a Spaceport starter kit that provides the basic structure and configuration
for building a Spaceport application, with no other assumptions.

## Getting Started

If this is your first time using Spaceport, perhaps consider starting with the PORT-MERCURY,
or PORT-PIONEER starter kits, which provide the same basic structure and configuration, but
provide some basic functionality to get you started. Use Port-Echo if you want to start
from scratch and want to implement the basics yourself.

## Features

- Basic structure and configuration for a Spaceport application
- No assumptions about the application
- Ready to launch, just add your own code.
